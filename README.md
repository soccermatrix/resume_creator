# Resume Creator
Resume creator is a personal project to create my own resume.

## Tools Used:
- Adobe inDesign
- Adobe Illustrator

#### Main Working File
- resume_creator.indd
  - All your work will be done in this file.

#### Exporter File
- resume_exporter.indd
Once you are finished making your updates. 
  - Open this file and then export your resume as a pdf.
  - File > Export > export as pdf

#### Vector Shapes
- There are a few shapes in the document.
- The "Circle" infographic shape is in the /illustrator/ folder
  - You will need Adobe Illustrator installed
- All other shapes were created inside inDesing

#### Editing the "Bar" shapes
- The bars are conveniently styled using "Swatches"
- Just select the swatch with the percent you want the bar to be filled to
  - Currently there is a range of bar swatches from 80% to 100%
  
#### Using the resume_exporter.indd
Export your resume using this file to ensure the pdf will print with the right margins.
- Open this file in inDesign.
- Open the "Links" properties (Window > Links)
- Click the only linked document and then select Refresh.
  - You may need to relink to the resume_creator.indd based on your folder structure.
- Once you see your latest changes made to resume_creator, you're ready to print.
- File > Export
- Select file name and format (pdf) and export it.
  - You can make additinoal changes to the pdf file, I recommend leave the default settings.
  
  #### Character / Paragraph / Object Styles
  - Almost every element has a style.
  - Click on different elements and use the Character Styles, Paragraph Styles, or Object Styles panel to get familiar.
  - Making changes to any of these styles will affect all elements sharing the same style.
  - This saves time if you need to change the color or font of similar elements in the document.
